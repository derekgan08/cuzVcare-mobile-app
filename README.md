# CAT304 Project: cuzVcare Mobile App

## Problem Statements
Volunteering organizations and volunteers often struggle with managing and tracking events effectively. With disparate systems for event registration, attendance tracking, and rewards, both volunteers and organizations face numerous inefficiencies and challenges such as:

- **Low Discoveries of Event Information:** There are a lot of volunteers out there who are keen on participating these activities but due to there is no specific platform to host all these information at the same platform to ease discovery, many of them are not aware that these activities are going on.

- **Activities Signups and Participations:** Participants who are interested in taking part in the activities will sometimes forget the activity, date, time or the venue due to forgetful. Some of them who have signed up for the activity but are absent due to various reasons, which will result in the number of participants who have signed up is lesser than the number of participants who are actually turning up in the activities.

- **Difficulties in Conveying Messages:** In the event of unexpected issues such as rain, inevitable postponement of activities, change of activities details etc., announcements or updates such as the new date and time are difficult to convey to all the participants. Hence, a lot of them are not aware of the latest arrangements. Even if we can use phone calling to notify them one by one, it will be tedious if many participants is involved.

- **Activity Records Management:** Mostly, all the activity records are either incomplete or not well documented. Even if the records are complete, they are not shared with others. This results in future activities do not having enough references and difficult to find solutions when necessary.

- **Lack of Awareness and Motivation in Event Participation:** Even if some people have discovered the activity, there are very less of them who would like to join because they think these activities are wasting time. Some of them might feel that the event information provided is not attractive enough to motivate them to participate.
 
- **Vulnerability of Sensitive Information:** Most of the time, the organizers will collect the information of participants when they sign up for an activity. The information is not guaranteed to be safe and is at the risk of being stolen or exposed.

- **Lack of interaction platform:** The difficulty in coordinating and communicating effectively among volunteers due to a lack of a dedicated online platform for managing and organizing volunteer efforts.

## Project Overview
Unsustainable cities and human settlements is one of the major issue in the current world and is particularly severe in poor countries. In around the world, pollutions, waste management, and natural disasters are prevalent issues and actions must be taken to mitigate it. However, volunteering activities, as one of the most effective mitigating methods, is lacking and not carried out profusely. One of the main reasons is because there is no focused, organized, secure and trustworthy communication hub to host volunteering activity information. We aim to reduce these issues by engineering a volunteer recruitment platform named “cuzVcare”. The platform aims to host all the event information on the same platform while motivate users in participating events, allow users to discover and sign up for the events they would like to join as well as enable the users to keep track the events they have signed up and bookmark the events they are interested to join. 

cuzVcare is designed to streamline the management and participation of volunteering events developed as a mobile application which can be run on Android and iOS Operating Systems as mobile application has the highest volume of users in the current trend. This application can be used by anyone from any part of the world in order to create a more sustainable cities and human settlements as aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 11.

The app serves as an efficient tool to encourage volunteering, making it easier for users to engage with local events and be rewarded for their contributions.
